# Tasks

## Note: You can make different branches with your name like Antriksh1, Antriksh2, Antriksh3 like this when needed.
### You can also help each other with tasks, just make sure you learn everything and don't cheat ðŸ˜‡

### Task 0: Setup your local environment of git using git init

(Use fetch origin commands and research about and complete the task)<br>
pull the main branch from the repo<br>
pull the lazy branch<br>
pull the newbranch branch<br>


### Task 1: Basic Git Commands

Create a new branch in the repository with your own name (example: <branch name> = Antriksh)<br>
Add a new file to the branch and commit the changes.<br>
Push the branch to the remote repository.<br>
Create a pull request (PR) to merge the branch into the main branch.<br>


### Task 2: Collaborative Work

Collaborate with each other (Akash and Ajay), (Meet and Khushi)<br>
Both collaborators should make changes to same file (<file name> = (Name1Name2) e.g. AkashAjay) simultaneously.<br>
Resolve any merge conflicts that arise during this process.<br>


### Task 3: Git History

Use git log to view the commit history of the repository.<br>
Identify a specific commit by its hash and display its details.<br>


### Task 4: Branching and Merging


Create a branch with your name.<br>
Make multiple commits to the feature branch (atleast 3) (with your file names only).<br>
Merge the feature branch into the main branch.<br>


### Task 5: Merge Conflicts Resolution

Make two branches of your name and try to make merge conflicts.<br>
And then merge one of them into another and resolve the merge conflict.<br>


### Task 6: Gitignore

Add files ".DS_Store" , "node_modules", and ".env" into a branch named (<Name_Gitignore> e.g. Antriksh_Gitignore).<br>
Create a .gitignore file in the repository to ignore specific files or directories.<br>
Add common entries to ignore files like .DS_Store, node_modules/, and .env.<br>
and then push the whole thing into your branch<br>
